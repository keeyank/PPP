This repository houses all of my work on the exercises from Programming: Principles and Practice by Bjarne Stroustrup. 

I indicate projects with a '\*' at the beginning of the filename to indicate that they are worth review. 

For the projects from Ch12 to Ch16, you need to install fltk to properly run them. If you have fltk, they're really easy to run - just type in make and ./test or ./a or whatever I named the executable. 

Almost everything else can be executed like you normally would for a single c++ file.

Compile single files with g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic [filename].cpp
